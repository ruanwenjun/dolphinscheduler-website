  "__html": "<h3>DolphinScheduler Global Parameters</h3>\n<p>DolphinScheduler contains the following three types of parameters:</p>\n<p>① Parameters defined when the workflow saves page definitions</p>\n<p>② Parameters passed by upstream nodes</p>\n<p>③ The node's own parameters, which is the parameters defined by the user in [Custom Parameters]. The user can define the value of this part of the parameters at the time of workflow definition.</p>\n<p>The global parameters described in this article refer to the parameters passed by the ② upstream nodes.</p>\n<h4>User Manual</h4>\n<h5>The use of parameters:</h5>\n<p>When you are defining a node, the node may use all three of these parameters, such as ${parameter name}. The priority of three parameters is ①&gt;②&gt;③, that is, when three parameter names are repeated, the value of ① is preferred, followed by ②, and the last is ③. The parameters currently can apply to all nodes.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the partial parameters may exist the same name when using the upstream node to pass the parameters. If this happens, the program will use the non-null value of them. If more than one non-null value exists, the value passed by the upstream node that ends first is selected. The user needs to know this in advance when defining the process.</p>\n<p>For example, the relationships are shown in the figures below:</p>\n<p>1: The first case is explained by the shell nodes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723102938239.png\" alt=\"png01\"></p>\n<p>The [useParam] node can use the parameters which is set in the [createParam] node. The [useParam] node does not have a dependency on the [noUseParam] node, so it does not get the parameters of the [noUseParam] node. The above picture is just an example of a shell node, other types of nodes have the same usage rules.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723103316896.png\" alt=\"png02\"></p>\n<p>Among all, the [createParam] node can use parameters directly. In addition, the node sets two parameters named &quot;key&quot; and &quot;key1&quot;. Here the user defines a parameter named &quot;key1&quot; with the same name as the one passed by the upstream node and copies the value &quot;12&quot;. However, due to the priority we set, the value &quot;12&quot; here would be discarded and the parameter value set by the upstream node would be finally used.</p>\n<p>2: Let's explain another situation in SQL nodes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723103937052.png\" alt=\"png03\"></p>\n<p>The definition of the [use_create] node is as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723104411489.png\" alt=\"png04\"></p>\n<p>&quot;status&quot; is the own parameters of the node set by the current node. However, the user also sets the &quot;status&quot; parameter when saving, assigning its value to -1. Then the value of status will be -1 with higher priority when the SQL is executed. The value of the node's own variable is discarded.</p>\n<p>The &quot;ID&quot; here is the parameter set by the upstream node. The user sets the parameters of the same parameter name &quot;ID&quot; for the [createparam1] node and [createparam2] node. And the [use_create] node uses the value of [createParam1] which is finished first.</p>\n<h5>Parameter setting:</h5>\n<p>When defining an upstream node, if there is a need to transmit the result of that node to a downstream node that has a dependency. You need to set a parameter whose direction is OUT in [Custom Parameters] of [Current Node Settings]. At present, we mainly focus on the function of SQL and SHELL nodes that can input parameters.</p>\n<p>prop is user-specified; the direction is selected as OUT, and will be defined as parameter output only when the direction is OUT. The data type can be chosen from different data structures as needed; the value part is not required.</p>\n<p>If the result of the SQL node  has only one row, one or more fields, the name of the prop needs to be the same as the field name. The data type can be chosen to be something other than LIST. The parameter will select the value corresponding to the column with the same name as this parameter in the column name in the SQL query result.</p>\n<p>If the result of the SQL node is multiple rows, one or more fields, the name of the prop needs to be the same as the name of the field. The data type is selected as LIST, and the SQL query result will be converted to LIST, and the result will be converted to JSON as the value of the corresponding parameter.</p>\n<p>Let's take another example of the process that contains the SQL node in the above picture:</p>\n<p>The [createParam1] node in the above figure is defined as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723104957031.png\" alt=\"png05\"></p>\n<p>[createParam2] node is defined as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723105026924.png\" alt=\"png06\"></p>\n<p>You can find the value of the variable in the [Workflow Instance] page to find the corresponding node instance.</p>\n<p>Node instance [createparam1] is as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723105131381.png\" alt=\"png07\"></p>\n<p>Here, the value of &quot;id&quot; is equal to 12.</p>\n<p>Let's see the case of the node instance [createparam2].</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723105255850.png\" alt=\"png08\"></p>\n<p>There is only the value of &quot;id&quot;. Although the user-defined sql looks up the fields &quot;id&quot; and &quot;database_name&quot;, only one parameter is set because only one parameter &quot;id&quot; is defined for out. For display reasons, the length of the list is already checked for you here as 10.</p>\n<h6>SHELL node</h6>\n<p>prop is user-specified. The direction is selected as OUT. The output is defined as a parameter only when the direction is OUT. Data type can choose different data structures as needed; the value part is not required to be filled. The user needs to pass the parameter, and when defining the shell script, the output format of $setValue(key=value) statement is required, key is the prop of the corresponding parameter, and value is the value of the parameter.</p>\n<p>For example, in the figure below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723101242216.png\" alt=\"png09\"></p>\n<p>When the log detects the ${setValue(key=value1)} format in the shell node definition, it will assign value1 to key, and the downstream node can use the value of the variable key directly. Similarly, you can find the corresponding node instance on the [Workflow Instance] page to see the value of the variable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/img/globalParam/image-20210723102522383.png\" alt=\"png10\"></p>\n<h4>Development documentation</h4>\n<p>After the user defines the parameter with the direction OUT, it is saved in the localParam of the task.</p>\n<h5>The use of parameters:</h5>\n<p>Getting the direct predecessor node preTasks of the current taskInstance to be created from the DAG, get the varPool of preTasks, merge this varPool (List) into one varPool, and in the merging process, if parameters with the same parameter name are found, they will be handled according to the following logics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If all the values are null, the merged value is null</li>\n<li>If one and only one value is non-null, then the merged value is the non-null value</li>\n<li>If all the values are not null, it would be the earliest value of the endtime of taskInstance taken by VarPool.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The direction of all the merged properties is updated to IN during the merge process.</p>\n<p>The result of the merge is saved in taskInstance.varPool.</p>\n<p>The worker receives and parses the varPool into the format of Map&lt;String,Property&gt;, where the key of the map is property.prop, which is the parameter name.</p>\n<p>When the processor processes the parameters, it will merge the varPool and localParam and globalParam parameters, and if there are parameters with duplicate names during the merging process, they will be replaced according to the following priorities, with the higher priority being retained and the lower priority being replaced:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>globalParam: high</li>\n<li>varPool: middle</li>\n<li>localParam: low</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The parameters are replaced with the corresponding values using regular expressions compared to ${parameter name} before the node content is executed.</p>\n<h5>Parameter setting:</h5>\n<p>Currently, only SQL and SHELL nodes are supported to get parameters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get the parameter with direction OUT from localParam, and do the following way according to the type of different nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>SQL node:</h6>\n<p>The structure returned by the parameter is List&lt;Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt;, where the elements of List are each row of data, the key of Map is the column name, and the value is the value corresponding to the column.</p>\n<pre><code>(1) If the SQL statement returns one row of data, match the OUT parameter name based on the OUT parameter name defined by the user when defining the task, or discard it if it does not match.\n\n(2) If the SQL statement returns multiple rows of data, the column names are matched based on the OUT parameter names defined by the user when defining the task of type LIST.
